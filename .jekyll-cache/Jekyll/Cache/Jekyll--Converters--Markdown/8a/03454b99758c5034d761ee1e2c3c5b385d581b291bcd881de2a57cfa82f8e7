<p>According to <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/85843/cloudy-earth">NASA</a>, only about 30% of the Earthâ€™s land is completely free of clouds. This cloud cover presents a major challenge for satellite imagery analysis since clouds often obscure the land features we want to see. Such a hindrance can impede any number of tasks, from monitoring deforestation to estimating energy consumption. The goal of the project is to create an algorithm that can identify which pixels in a 512x512 pixel image are clouds and which are not clouds. For the uninitiated, the project involves semantic segmentation, or the assignment of individual pixels from an image to particular groups. I completed this project alongside two graduate student classmates as part of the Applied Machine Learning course from UC Berkeleyâ€™s Masterâ€™s of Information and Data Science program.</p>
