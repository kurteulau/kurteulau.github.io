<p>Millions of people in Nigeria lack access to electricity, either through intermittent power delivery via the national grid or lack of transmission
lines that can reach their household. As we move towards a decarbonized future, off-grid solar power provides a powerful tool to address both
energy poverty and climate change. Enterprises or development partners seeking to find the best places to introduce off-grid solar products, however, 
do not always know which locations present the best environment for success.</p>
