<h2 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h2>
<p>The United States <a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ">Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)</a> reports that only % of flights depart on time. The <a href="https://www.faa.gov/be-atc">Air Traffic Controllers (ATC)</a> of the <a href="https://www.faa.gov">Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)</a> are responsible for coordinating departures at US airports. The sooner ATCs can receive information on which flights are likely to depart late, the better they can plan mitigation strategies to ensure smooth airport operations. In this project, I, along with four other UC Berkeley data science graduate students, analyzed data from the BTS  and <a href="https://www.weather.gov">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</a> from 2015 through 2020 to predict the difference between scheduled and actual departure time of flights leaving from US airports in 2021. Specifically, we predict departure delays given information no sooner than 2 hours before expected departures. We theorized that by predicting the magnitude of delay rather than just the presence or absence of a delay, ATCs will be better positioned to optimally allocate resources to start resolving high-priority problems before they arise. Additionally, we implemented a Multilayer Percpetron via MLlib to classify flights as either 15 minutes late or not.</p>

<p>To make these predictions, we engineered several features then proceed to use a Spark DL XGBoost algorithm to achieve a RMSE of about 33 minutes.</p>
