<p>Millions of people in Nigeria lack access to electricity, either through intermittent power delivery via the national grid or lack of transmission
lines that can reach their household. As we move towards a decarbonized future, off-grid solar power provides a powerful tool to address both
energy poverty and climate change. Currently, individuals living off-grid either lack electricity or rely on diesel generators for power
and often turn to kerosene lamps for light. Consumer grade photovoltaic systems can provide light and power generation, keeping money 
in consumer pockets and preventing carbon from entering the atmosphere.</p>
