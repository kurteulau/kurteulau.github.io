<p>
    This report was a group assignment required for the UC Berkeley MIDS w203 Statistics for Data Science course, which I completed during Fall 2021.
    The goal of the project was use multivariable linear regression within an causal theory to explain how much Americans consider 
    horsepower when purchasing a new vehicle. I significantly contributed to the introduction, EDA, model building and selection, as well as results 
    sections of the report. All data wrangling, cleaning, and analysis were completed in R using RStudio. To complete our research, we utilized a variety 
    of statistical concepts:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Multi-variable linear regression</li>
    <li>Sampling methodology</li>
    <li>Variable transformation</li>
    <li>Model selection</li>
    <li>Robust standard errors</li>
    <li>Omitted variable bias</li>
    <li>Reverse causality</li>
</ul>
