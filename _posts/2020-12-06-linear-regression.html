<p>
    This report was a group assignment required for UC Berkeley MIDS w203 Statistics for Data Science course, which I completed during the Fall 2021 term.
    The goal of the project was use multivariable linear regression within an causal theory to explain how much Americans seemed to care about 
    horsepower when purchasing a new vehicle. I significantly contributed to the introduction, EDA, model building and selection, as well as results 
    sections of the report. All data wrangling, cleaning, and analysis were completed in R using RStudio. To complete our research, we utilized a variety 
    of statistical concepts:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Linear regression</li>
    <li>Sampling methodology</li>
    <li>Variable transformation</li>
    <li>Robust standard errors</li>
    <li>Model selection</li>
    <li>Omitted variable bias</li>
    <li>Reverse causality</li>
</ul>
