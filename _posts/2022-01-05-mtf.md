## Problem Description
Access to energy for lighting and cooking presents a formidable obstacle to development in Nigeria. Solar energy in particular could play
a meaningful role in alleviating energy poverty in Nigeria and elsewhere. In order to provide basic information
about electricity as well as cooking fuels, the World Bank conducts "Multi-Tier Framework" surveys in conjunction with host nations.
For Nigeria, survey teams interviewed over 3,500 households. While the trove of data is public, it is also difficult to parse, 
requires additional cleaning, and is hard to understand without additional visualizations. As an analyst as Catalyst Off-Grid Advisors,
I am currently building data visualizations so Nigerian solar companies, development practioners, and more can leverage the MTF survey
data to inform their decision making.
