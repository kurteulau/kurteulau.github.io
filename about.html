    Hello! I'm a data scientist with 8+ years of experience teaching machine learning, math, and computer science with 2 years service as a Peace Corps volunteer in Cambodia. I'm a self-starter, strategic thinker, and great communicator currently making an impact at a solar consulting firm serving clients in Sub-Saharan Africa.

    I currently reside in Mountain View, California. In my spare time I enjoy hanging out with my spouse, playing boardgames, birding, reading, basketball, and  
    exploring the outdoors. Each of the photos used in the Home, About, Posts, and Contact pages are pictures I took in a different national park. 10 
    points for Gryffindor if you can name each park!
