    Before developing a passion for data science, I was a UC Berkeley undergraduate student and then a Peace Corps
    Volunteer in Cambodia. After Peace Corps, I taught math and computer science in Title I public schools in New 
    York City and California for seven years. Teaching math and computer science motivated me to explore the nexus 
    of those two disciplines: data science. You can now find me completing the UC Berkeley Master of Information and 
    Data Science program as a graduate student while improving the capacity of solar energy companies as an analyst 
    with Catalyst Off-Grid Advisors.

    I currently reside in Mountain View, California. In my spare time I enjoy hangning out with my spouse, playing boardgames, surfing, reading, and 
    exploring the outdoors. Each of the photosused in the Home, About, Posts, and Contact pages are pictures I took in a different national park. 10 
    points for Gryffindor if you can name each park!
